In order to reproduce the results of this project we need to follow the following steps to run the code using the same environment:

1. Install docker by installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or just [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) if your is linux is your operating system. In Manjaro, you can install it using the next command to install the Docker Engine:

```bash
sudo pacman -S docker
```

2. Start the docker by opening the Docker Desktop or running the systemctl start command for docker.service based on the systemd packeage.

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker.service
```

3. To avoid using sudo with each docker command, you can add yourself to the docker group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

4. Download the image related with this problem.

```bas
docker pull angelfelizr/project.nyc.taxi:0.0.99                                  
```

5. Change to a directory where you want to save the project. You can see the path by running the next command.

```bash
pwd
```

6. Create a directory to save the package cache related to the project.

```bash
mkdir cache_4.3
```

7. Download the repo by running `git clone` or downloading as a zip.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AngelFelizR/project.nyc.taxi.git
```

8. After creating both folders we can run the our container by running the next command based on your working directory.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

9. Then you can go to your favorite browser and go to [localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555/).

11. Click over `~/project.nyc.taxi/project.nyc.taxi.Rproj` to open the project.

12. Install the package used:

```r
renv::restore()
```

13. To reproduce the analysis presented we have to alternatives:

  - Using the function `devtools::build_rmd()` to render each article without install the library.

```r
devtools::build_rmd("vignettes/01-data-collection-process.Rmd")
```

  - Installing the library local library to be able to run the code in an interactive session.
  
```r
devtools::install_local()
```
  

14. If you want to keep running the container you can kill it.

```bash
docker container kill project
```
