In order to reproduce the results of this project we need to follow the following steps to run the code using the same environment:

1. Install docker by installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or just [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) if your is linux is your operating system. In Manjaro, you can install it using the next command to install the Docker Engine:

```bash
sudo pacman -S docker
```

2. Start the docker by opening the Docker Desktop or running the systemctl start command for docker.service based on the systemd packeage.

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker.service
```

3. To avoid using sudo with each docker command, you can add yourself to the docker group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

4. Dowload the latest image related with this problem.

```bas
docker pull angelfelizr/proyect.nyc.taxi:0.0.99                                  
```
