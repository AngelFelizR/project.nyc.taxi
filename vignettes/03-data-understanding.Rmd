After completing the [business understanding](https://angelfelizr.github.io/project.nyc.taxi/articles/02-business-understanding.html) phase we are ready to perform the **data understanding** phase by performing an EDA with the following steps:

1. Exploring the individual distribution of variables.
3. Taking a subset of the data to fit in RAM.
4. Exploring correlations between predictors and target variable.
5. Exploring correlations between predictors.


In order to:

- Ensure data quality
- Identify key predictors
- Detect multicollinearity
- Guide model choice and feature engineering

## Setting the environment up

To setting the `R` environment up we just need to apply the following 4 steps:

1. Loading the packages to use.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(project.nyc.taxi)
library(here)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(forcats)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(arrow)

options(datatable.print.nrows = 15)
```

2. Creating an Arrow connection object to perform some **manipulations in disk** before taking the data into the RAM memory.

```{r}
NycTrips2022 <- 
  here("raw-data/trip-data/year=2022") |>
  open_dataset()

NycTrips2022
```

4. Importing the zone code description.

```{r}
ZoneCodes <- fread(
  here("raw-data/taxi_zone_lookup.csv"),
  colClasses = c("integer",
                 "character",
                 "character",
                 "character")
)

glimpse(ZoneCodes)
```

5. Counting the number of trips for each code, collecting and translating the zone codes.

```{r}
TripsZoneDistribution <-
  NycTrips2022 |>
  count_pct(PULocationID, DOLocationID) |>
  join_zones(zone_tb = ZoneCodes)

glimpse(TripsZoneDistribution)
```


## Individual distributions

### Categorical variables



#### company

The majority number of trips are done by *Uber* (HV003) and the rest for *Lyft*.

```{r}
NycTrips2022 |> 
  count_pct(company = case_when(hvfhs_license_num == "HV0002" ~ "Juno",
                                hvfhs_license_num == "HV0003" ~ "Uber",
                                hvfhs_license_num == "HV0004" ~ "Via",
                                hvfhs_license_num == "HV0005" ~ "Lyft"))
```

#### dispatching_base_num

For most of the trips the dispatching number are **B03404** and **B03406**. The remaining codes represent a small proportion of observations.

```{r}
NycTrips2022 |>
  count_pct(dispatching_base_num)
```

#### originating_base_num

For most of the trips the originating number is **B03404** and the second is missing. The remaining codes represent a small proportion of observations.

```{r}
NycTrips2022 |>
  count_pct(originating_base_num)
```

#### access_a_ride_flag

Must of the trips doesn't provide any information related to whether they were administered on behalf of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the remaining confirm that there aren't.

```{r}
NycTrips2022 |>
  count_pct(access_a_ride_flag)
```

#### shared_request_flag

Most of passengers **don't request** to a shared/pooled ride.

```{r}
NycTrips2022 |>
  count_pct(shared_request_flag)
```

#### shared_match_flag

Most of passengers don't request to a shared/pooled ride, but even **fewer achieved to share the ride**.

```{r}
NycTrips2022 |> 
  count_pct(shared_match_flag)
```

#### wav_request_flag

It's really **unusual to request a wheelchair-accessible** vehicle.

```{r}
NycTrips2022 |> 
  count_pct(wav_request_flag)
```

#### wav_match_flag

It's really unusual to request a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, but we have more tips take place in wheelchair-accessible vehicles, so **it seems that the service has the capacity to meet the demand**.

```{r}
NycTrips2022 |> 
  count_pct(wav_match_flag)
```

#### start_borough

**87% of trips** start in *Manhattan*, *Brooklyn* or *Queens*.

```{r}
TripsZoneDistribution |>
  count_pct(start_borough, wt =  n)
```

#### end_borough

**82% of trips** end in *Manhattan*, *Brooklyn* or *Queens*.

```{r}
TripsZoneDistribution |>
  count_pct(end_borough, wt =  n)
```

#### start_service_zone

**96% of trips** start in *Boro Zone* and *Yellow Zone*.

```{r}
TripsZoneDistribution |>
  count_pct(start_service_zone, wt =  n)
```

> We need to recode EWR are Airports to keep the classification consistent.

#### end_service_zone

**91% of trips** start in *Boro Zone* and *Yellow Zone*.

```{r}
TripsZoneDistribution |>
  count_pct(end_service_zone, wt =  n)
```

> We need to recode EWR are Airports to keep the classification consistent.

### Time variables

#### request_datetime

Let's start confirming the variable doesn't have any missing value.

```{r}
NycTrips2022 |>
  count_pct(request_datetime_missing = is.na(request_datetime))
```

To describe this variable, we decomposed it in different parts and count the number trips by each element and store the summary as a `data.table` to explore each part using visualizations.

```{r}
RequestTimeSummary <-
  NycTrips2022 |>
  transmute(parquet_month = make_date(2022L, month),
            request_datetime,
            request_date = as_date(request_datetime)) |>
  count(parquet_month,
        request_month = floor_date(request_date, unit = "month"),
        request_week = floor_date(request_date, unit = "week"),
        request_day = day(request_date),
        request_hour = hour(request_datetime),
        request_weekday = wday(request_date, week_start = 1)) |>
  collect() |>
  as.data.table()
```

- `month`: As we can see below most the months related to parquet files match with the request, as consequence there is no reason to keep that variable.

```{r}
RequestTimeSummary[, .(n = sum(n)),
                   by = c("parquet_month", "request_month")] |>
  ggplot(aes(request_month, parquet_month))+
  geom_abline(color = "grey60",
              linewidth = 1.1)+
  geom_point(aes(size = n),
             color = "dodgerblue4")+
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%y-%m",
               date_breaks = "2 months")+
  scale_y_date(date_labels = "%y-%m",
               date_breaks = "months")+
  scale_size_continuous(labels = comma_format(),
                        breaks = c(5e3, 1.5e7))+
  labs(title = "Comparting Request and Parquet File Months",
       x = "Trips Request Month",
       y = "Trips per Parquet File",
       size = "Number of Trips")+
  coord_equal()+
  theme_light()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top")
```

In the next chart, we can see that the number trips keeps almost constant must of the year, but we have some fewer trips during the first 2 months and some extra trips in October and December.

```{r}
RequestTimeSummary[year(request_month) == 2022, 
                   .(n = sum(n)),
                   by = "request_month"] |>
  ggplot(aes(request_month, n))+
  geom_line(color = "grey60",
            linewidth = 0.9)+
  geom_point(color = "dodgerblue4",
             size = 3)+
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%y-%m",
               date_breaks = "2 months")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(),
                     breaks = breaks_width(2e6))+
  labs(title = "Distribution of Trips by Month",
       x = "Trips Request Month",
       y = "Number of Trips")+
  expand_limits(y = 0)+
  theme_light()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top")
```

By breaking the months into weeks we can confirm we have fewer trips in the first 2 months, in relation to October we don't see a big change in he number of trips we see is that it has more weeks than November, but December keeps having more trips than normal in the first 2 weeks.

```{r}
RequestTimeSummary[year(request_month) == 2022, 
                   .(n = sum(n)),
                   by = "request_week"] |>
  ggplot(aes(request_week, n))+
  geom_line(color = "grey60",
            linewidth = 0.9)+
  geom_point(color = "dodgerblue4",
             size = 3)+
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%y-%m",
               date_breaks = "month")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(),
                     breaks = breaks_width(5e5))+
  labs(title = "Distribution of Trips by Week",
       x = "Trips Request Week",
       y = "Number of Trips")+
  expand_limits(y = 0)+
  theme_light()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top")
```

If we explore the number of trips by month day we can not see any consistent pattern after plotting a line with total of trips for each month.

```{r}
RequestTimeSummary[year(request_month) == 2022, 
                   .(n = sum(n)),
                   by = .(request_month = format(request_month, "%B"),
                          request_day)] |>
  ggplot(aes(request_day, n))+
  geom_line(aes(group = request_month),
            color = "gray60",
            linewidth = 0.1)+
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess',
              formula = 'y ~ x',
              se = FALSE,
              linewidth = 1.2)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(5))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format())+
  expand_limits(y = 0)+
  labs(title = "Number of Trips by Month Day",
       y = "Number of Trips",
       x = "Day of Month")+
  theme_light()+
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

By if we change the month day in the prior chart with week day we can find that the number of trips trends to be higher Fridays and Saturdays.

```{r}
RequestTimeSummary[year(request_month) == 2022, 
                   .(n = sum(n)),
                   by = .(request_month = format(request_month, "%B"),
                          request_weekday)] |>
  ggplot(aes(request_weekday, n))+
  geom_line(aes(group = request_month),
            color = "gray60")+
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess',
              formula = 'y ~ x',
              se = FALSE,
              linewidth = 1.2)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = breaks_width(1),
                     labels = factor_weekday)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format())+
  expand_limits(y = 0)+
  labs(title = "Number of Trips by Week Day",
       y = "Number of Trips",
       x = "Day of Week")+
  theme_light()+
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

To understand better what is happening Fridays and Saturdays let's break each week day by hour. In the next chart, we can see how the higher number of trips start at  17:00 and end at 1:00 of next day for Fridays and Saturdays.

```{r}
RequestTimeSummary[year(request_month) == 2022, 
                   .(n = sum(n)),
                   by = .(request_hour = 
                            factor(request_hour) |> fct_rev(), 
                          request_weekday = factor_weekday(request_weekday))
  ][, n_million := n/1e6 ] |>
  ggplot(aes(request_weekday, request_hour))+
  geom_tile(aes(fill = n),
            color = "black",
            linewidth = 0.005)+
  geom_text(aes(label = comma(n_million, accuracy = 0.1, suffix = " M")))+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", 
                      high = "dodgerblue4",
                      labels= comma_format())+
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") +
  labs(title = "Number of Trips by Hour and Week Day",
       fill = "Number of Trips",
       x = "Request Week Day",
       y = "Request Hour") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "black"))
```

```{r}
TripMilesSummary <-

```

```{r}

## Additinal exploration

- `start_borough` and `end_borough`: After exploring the next distribution of trips we can highlight that:

  - 94% of the trips take place in *Manhattan*, *Brooklyn*, *Queens* and *Bronx*. As consequence, there is no reason to keep exploring trips related to *Staten Island*, *EWR* or *Unknown* as they are the minority.
  - 70% the trips take place without going to outside the start borough.

```{r}
TripsZoneDistribution[, .(n = sum(n)),
                      by = c("start_borough", "end_borough")
][order(n)
][, c("start_borough", "end_borough") := 
    lapply(.SD, \(x) factor(x, levels = unique(x, fromLast = TRUE)) ),
  .SDcols = c("start_borough", "end_borough")
][, end_borough := fct_rev(end_borough)] |>
  ggplot(aes(end_borough, start_borough))+
  geom_tile(aes(fill = n)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = percent(n/sum(n), accuracy = 0.01))) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", 
                      high = "red",
                      labels= comma_format())+
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Trips by Borough in NYC 2022",
       x = "Trip End", 
       y = "Trip Start", 
       fill = "Number of Trips") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "italic"))
```

- `start_service_zone` and `end_service_zone`: 52% of the trips take place at the *Boro Zone*, 26% of trips take place at the *Yellow Zone* and only small fraction goes to the *Airports*.

```{r}
TripsZoneDistribution[  
  !start_borough %chin% c("Staten Island", "Unknown", "EWR") &
    !end_borough %chin% c("Staten Island", "Unknown", "EWR"), 
  .(n = sum(n)),
  by = c("start_service_zone",
         "end_service_zone")
][order(n)
][, c("start_service_zone", "end_service_zone") := 
    lapply(.SD, \(x) factor(x, levels = unique(x, fromLast = TRUE)) ),
  .SDcols = c("start_service_zone", "end_service_zone")
][, end_service_zone := fct_rev(end_service_zone)] |>
  ggplot(aes(end_service_zone, start_service_zone))+
  geom_tile(aes(fill = n)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = percent(n/sum(n), accuracy = 0.01))) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", 
                      high = "red",
                      labels= comma_format())+
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Trips by Service Zone in NYC 2022",
       x = "Trip End", 
       y = "Trip Start", 
       fill = "Number of Trips") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "italic"))
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false

ZoneUniqueComb <-
  TripsZoneDistribution[ 
    !start_borough %chin% c("Staten Island", "Unknown", "EWR") & 
      !end_borough %chin% c("Staten Island", "Unknown", "EWR"),
    unique(.SD),
    .SDcols = c("start_zone", "end_zone")
  ][, .N] |>
  comma()

EndingUniqueZones <-
  TripsZoneDistribution[ 
    !start_borough %chin% c("Staten Island", "Unknown", "EWR") & 
      !end_borough %chin% c("Staten Island", "Unknown", "EWR"),
    uniqueN(end_zone),] |>
  comma()
```


- `start_zone` and `end_zone`: As our data has `r ZoneUniqueComb` rows of relations between both columns, we opted to transform data in a way what each unique zone represent a row reducing the points to be plotted to only `r EndingUniqueZones` by following the next steps: 

  1. Summarizing the total number of trips for each **starting point** independently to its destination 
  2. Summarizing the total number of trips for each **ending point** independently to its origin.
  3. Joining both tables into one.

```{r}
# 1. Summarizing Staring Zones
StartingZonesCount <-
  TripsZoneDistribution[
    !start_borough %chin% c("Staten Island", "Unknown", "EWR") &
      !end_borough %chin% c("Staten Island", "Unknown", "EWR"),
    .(start_trips = sum(n)),
    by =  .(borough = start_borough, 
            zone = start_zone)
  ]

# 2. Summarizing Ending Zones
EndingZonesCount <-
  TripsZoneDistribution[
    !start_borough %chin% c("Staten Island", "Unknown", "EWR") &
      !end_borough %chin% c("Staten Island", "Unknown", "EWR"), 
    .(end_trips = sum(n)),
    by =  .(borough = end_borough, 
            zone = end_zone)
  ]

# 3. Inner Joining Starting and Ending Zones Counts
JoinedZonesCount <-
  StartingZonesCount[
    EndingZonesCount,
    on = c("borough", "zone"),
    nomatch = 0
  ]
```

Once we have a much simpler data to work with, we is easy to confirm with the next linear regression that `start_trips` and `end_trips` has almost the same values the model has an slope of one. That means that in must of cases **if someone takes a taxi to go to any place it's really likely to take another taxi back**.

```{r}
lm(end_trips ~ start_trips, 
   data = JoinedZonesCount) |>
  summary()
```

Let's now explore the zones where there is **no balance** between the `start_trips` and the `end_trips` in the most visited zoned of each Borough. To do so, we defined the rate `end_trips`/`start_trips` and highlight zones with lower rate than the 15% percentile or higher rate than 85% percentile.

```{r}
# Creating dataset to plot
ZonesCountToPlot <-
  copy(JoinedZonesCount)[
    j = `:=`(ending_starting_rate = end_trips/start_trips,
             borough = fct_reorder(borough, -end_trips, .fun = sum, na.rm = TRUE),
             end_m_trips = end_trips / 1e6L,
             start_m_trips = start_trips / 1e6L)
  ][, unbalance_situation := fcase(
    ending_starting_rate < quantile(ending_starting_rate, 0.15),
    "More starts than ends",
    ending_starting_rate > quantile(ending_starting_rate, 0.85),
    "More ends than starts",

  )

        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

Based on the results, we can highlight the next points:

1. The airports present in Queens, *LaGuardia Airport* and *JFK Airport*, have many more trips going to the airport than going out of airport. This might happen due that there are more transportation options like other taxis, shuttles, and public transportation.

2. The remaining zones, *Jackson Heights*, *East Village* and *TriBeCa/Civic Center*, are residential zones with a variety of public transportation options.
