## Data used

In this project will use a subset of the data available in the [TLC Trip
Record
Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).

I will focus our attention to the 2022 and 2023 data available on the
**High Volume For-Hire Vehicle** as you can see below.

Where each **row represents a single trip** in an FHV dispatched by one
of NYC’s licensed High Volume FHV bases and each column has next meaning
based on [data
dictionary](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_hvfhs.pdf)
avaible on the web page.
