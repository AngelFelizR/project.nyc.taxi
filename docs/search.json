Based results, can highlight next points: airports present Queens, LaGuardia Airport JFK Airport, many trips going airport going airport. might happen due transportation options like taxis, shuttles, public transportation. remaining zones, Jackson Heights, East Village TriBeCa/Civic Center, residential zones variety public transportation options.","code":"NycTrips2022 |>    count(shared_request_flag, shared_match_flag) |>   collect() |>   group_by(shared_request_flag) |>   mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) |>   arrange(desc(shared_request_flag), desc(shared_match_flag)) #> # A tibble: 4 × 4 #> # Groups:   shared_request_flag [2] #>   shared_request_flag shared_match_flag         n      pct #>   <chr>               <chr>                 <int>    <dbl> #> 1 Y                   Y                    452035 0.244    #> 2 Y                   N                   1399327 0.756    #> 3 N                   Y                     47973 0.000228 #> 4 N                   N                 210516748 1.00 NycTrips2022 |> count_pct(company, access_a_ride_flag) #> # A tibble: 2 × 4 #>   company access_a_ride_flag         n   pct #>   <chr>   <chr>                  <int> <dbl> #> 1 Uber    \" \"                153847310 0.724 #> 2 Lyft    \"N\"                 58568773 0.276 NycTrips2022 |> count_pct(wav_request_flag) #> # A tibble: 2 × 3 #>   wav_request_flag         n     pct #>   <chr>                <int>   <dbl> #> 1 N                212142808 0.999   #> 2 Y                   273275 0.00129 NycTrips2022 |>    count(wav_request_flag, wav_match_flag) |>   collect() |>   group_by(wav_request_flag) |>   mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) |>   arrange(desc(wav_request_flag), desc(wav_match_flag)) #> # A tibble: 4 × 4 #> # Groups:   wav_request_flag [2] #>   wav_request_flag wav_match_flag         n    pct #>   <chr>            <chr>              <int>  <dbl> #> 1 Y                Y                 266935 0.977  #> 2 Y                N                   6340 0.0232 #> 3 N                Y               12369744 0.0583 #> 4 N                N              199773064 0.942 TripsZoneDistribution[, .(n = sum(n)),                       by = c(\"start_borough\", \"end_borough\") ][order(n) ][, c(\"start_borough\", \"end_borough\") :=      lapply(.SD, \\(x) factor(x, levels = unique(x, fromLast = TRUE)) ),   .SDcols = c(\"start_borough\", \"end_borough\") ][, end_borough := fct_rev(end_borough)] |>   ggplot(aes(end_borough, start_borough))+   geom_tile(aes(fill = n)) +   geom_text(aes(label = percent(n/sum(n), accuracy = 0.01))) +   scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\",                        high = \"red\",                       labels= comma_format())+   scale_x_discrete(position = \"top\") +   labs(title = \"Distribution of Trips by Borough in NYC 2022\",        x = \"Trip End\",         y = \"Trip Start\",         fill = \"Number of Trips\") +   theme_classic() +   theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),         axis.ticks = element_blank(),         axis.line = element_blank(),         axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),         axis.title = element_text(face = \"italic\")) TripsZoneDistribution[     !start_borough %chin% c(\"Staten Island\", \"Unknown\", \"EWR\") &     !end_borough %chin% c(\"Staten Island\", \"Unknown\", \"EWR\"),    .(n = sum(n)),   by = c(\"start_service_zone\",          \"end_service_zone\") ][order(n) ][, c(\"start_service_zone\", \"end_service_zone\") :=      lapply(.SD, \\(x) factor(x, levels = unique(x, fromLast = TRUE)) ),   .SDcols = c(\"start_service_zone\", \"end_service_zone\") ][, end_service_zone := fct_rev(end_service_zone)] |>   ggplot(aes(end_service_zone, start_service_zone))+   geom_tile(aes(fill = n)) +   geom_text(aes(label = percent(n/sum(n), accuracy = 0.01))) +   scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\",                        high = \"red\",                       labels= comma_format())+   scale_x_discrete(position = \"top\") +   labs(title = \"Distribution of Trips by Service Zone in NYC 2022\",        x = \"Trip End\",         y = \"Trip Start\",         fill = \"Number of Trips\") +   theme_classic() +   theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),         axis.ticks = element_blank(),         axis.line = element_blank(),         axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),         axis.title = element_text(face = \"italic\")) # 1.
